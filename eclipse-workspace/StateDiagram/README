This directory contains the State Diagram state machine framework.

State Diagram is distributed in pure source code form without any
build mechanics. It is completely up to users to build State Diagram 
according to their needs and preferences.

State Diagram was built and tested using GCC 13.2 with option 
--std=c++2a. Attempting to compile State Diagram with some GCC versions
earlier than 13.2 is known to have triggered compiler bugs, certainly 
so with GCC versions earlier than 9.1.

It is unknown whether State Diagram can still be compiled with current
versions of Clang.

State Diagram is free software. See the file whose name is LICENSE
for terms of use. See the file whose name is RELEASES for release
notes.
